# Serializer
This code is a realization of a test issue.
The tasks were completed in the project:
- Created classes for serializing and deserializing objects to byte array.
- It doesn't matter what type of object will be serialized.
- Only objects with primitive type fields may be serialized.

Features will be realized in the future:
- Flags for array separation will be refactored;
- Code exceptions handling will be added;
- Serialization for objects with reference type field will be added;
